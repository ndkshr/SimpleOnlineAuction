# SimpleOnlineAuction
Web Application Lab - Assignment project. The only thing used is JSP.

The main project directory is the __Auction__ directory in the repo.

The MySQL username and password for the local host are hardcoded as "_root_" (without the quotes).

No fancy front end is added to the site, just the basic HTML stuffs.
